# Space Engineers related codes

Here you can find codes for [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/). Mostly for the programmable block. To have the proper experience (IntelliSense and stuff), please use [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) to open the projects.

Note: Don't build or run the Visual Studio projects that I made for programmable blocks (it won't run)

## References

In order to use IntelliSense for Space Engineers you have to reference to the correct libaries. The location of these references at default is
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\`

If you have Steam installed on your computer at a different location, change the reference paths to the correct one.

Personally, I import these dll files:

- SpaceEngineers.Game.dll
- Sandbox.Common.dll
- VRage.dll
- VRageLibrary.dll
- VRage.Game.dll
- VRage.Math.dll
